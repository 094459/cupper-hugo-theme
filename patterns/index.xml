      <description>Serving locally While you&amp;rsquo;re creating content for your library, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to see what the finished product looks like. Fortunately, Infusion is easy to serve locally using the serve command:
npm run serve This will serve your working library on localhost:1313. Whenever you make changes to your library&amp;rsquo;s files, the site will automatically rebuild. No need to refresh the web page!
